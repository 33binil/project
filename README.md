# Pixel Junkie Creative Studios

Welcome to the official website of **Pixel Junkie Creative Studios** – a creative agency that brings ideas to life through design, development, and innovation.

🚀 This was my very first freelance project, fully designed and developed by me using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**. The website is fully responsive and includes smooth scroll-triggered animations for an engaging user experience.
